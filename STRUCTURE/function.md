* Mechanical Strength
	* Structural Integrity
 		* The CubeSat must be able to withstand launch forces, including vibration, 	acceleration, and shocks. It needs to be robust enough to endure the harsh conditions of space.
	* Thermal Management
 		* The structure should manage thermal expansion and contraction, as well as dissipate heat effectively. This often involves thermal coatings or radiators.
* Standard Dimensions
	* CubeSat Standard Sizes
		* CubeSats are usually built in standard sizes, with the most common being 1U (10x10x10 cm), 2U, 3U, and 6U. These dimensions must be adhered to in order to fit into deployers and launch vehicles.
* Mass Constraints
	* Weight Limits
 		* The CubeSat is a 3U and as such has a typical maximum weight of 6 kg.
* Deployment Mechanism
	* The CubeSat rails must integrate with the deployment mechanism, fitting in the required space and meeting the required surface roughness specification.
 * Modularity
 	* Modular Design
  		* The structure must accommodate the attachment of various components from the other subsystems.

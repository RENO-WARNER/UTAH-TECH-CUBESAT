NEED A GOOD NAME:

Skim over the CubeSat Design specification (CDS)

MISSION
- Launch


- Photograph
	- Wait for time near photograph zone
	- Detumble
	- Magnetorquers
	- Begin Reaction wheel
	- Take photos

- Transmit
	- Wait for time near 
	- Detumble
	- Magnetorquers
	- Begin reaction wheel to point
	- Transmit data
	- End transmission

EXAMPLES


# QUETZAL-1

# ORESAT


# SUBSYSTEM(ORDER BY IMPORTANCE)

- POWER
- CONTROL
- COMMUNICATION
- ADCS(ATTITUDE DETERMINATION AND CONTROL)
- PAYLOAD
- TEST/DEBUG


INTERSYSTEM COMMUNICATION
	BUS
	BACKPLANE

MODULAR VS CENTRAL



# POWER
- SOLAR
- BATTERY
- MANAGEMENT

I LIKE USING H BRIDGES FOR CONTROL OF POWER

# CONTROL
- CHIPS
	- STM32U5
- ISOLATION
	- OCTOCOUPLERS?
- REDUDANT
	CAN <-> SPI/I2C

	FRAM LOOKS TO BE RADIATION RESISTANT

# COMMUNICATION
	LORA?
	SSDV FOR SERIALIZATION?
	FREQUENCY
		915/433 MHZ
	
	ANTENNTA
		ISOTROPIC?
		GAIN?

	REDUDANT
		RF LOG DETECTORS?

# ADCS
- WHAT HAPPENS IF WE SPIN THE REACTION WHEEL OFF AXIS?

## DETERMINATION

- STAR-TRACKER
	- [COTS](https://github.com/oresat/COTS-Star-Tracker)
	- [CROSS](https://github.com/cross-space-open/star-tracker-core)
	- [HOKU](https://github.com/glennga/hoku)
	- [LOST(UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON)](https://github.com/UWCubeSat/lost/tree/master)
	- [OPEN STAR TRACKER](https://github.com/UBNanosatLab/openstartracker)
	- [SPEL](https://github.com/spel-uchile/Star_Tracker)
	- [TETRA3](https://github.com/esa/tetra3)

	ERRORS
		POSSIBLE 

		NEED TO CONFIRM THAT IMAGES WON'T BE SHAKY SO LOOK AT IMU FIRST

		SUN-TRACKER?
			REQUIRES ON RTC
			ONLY PROVIDES 2 DOF
		HORIZON-TRACKER?
			
			
	## CONTROL
		MAGNETORQUERS

		REACTION WHEELS


# PAYLOAD
	CAMERA?
		WAVELENGTHS(IR,VISIBLE,UV,ALL)?

		CHECK OUT LIQUID LENSES

		GET ONE WIHT ONBOARD IMAGE PROCESSING/MEMORY IF POSSIBLE

		PROTOCOL
			USB3?
				DIRECT CONNECTION TO MCU
				SLOWER FPS
			CSPI?
				HAS TO HAVE ANOTHER MCU ALONG WITH MEMORY

	TESTING
		CHECK IF DEPTH OF FIELD
		
		ACROSS THE CAMPUS?
		FAR AWAY MOUNTAIN?
		MOON FOCUSED?

	
WARNING: NEED ANOTHER NAME FOR CONTROL(CPU)


# TEST/DEBUG

SWD CONNNECTOR

EXTERNAL USB -> UART MODULE
EXTERNAL USB -> CHARGE
CHARGE LED

COMMUNICATION
	EVERY SINGLE COMMUNICATION ERROR
		PULLED HIGH
		PULLED LOW
		TIMEOUT
		BAD DATA
EVERY SINGLE IC
	WHOAMI REGISTER
	INTERNAL HARDWARE TESTS

Lots of test points



	CAN
	I2C/SPI
	UART


	HARD BOARD
	FLEX BOARD
	WIRE

# Utah Tech CubeSat: Reports

These reports will:
* Allow everyone to work independently
* Allow everyone to prove their work in a structured way.

**Report Content:**
Each subsystem development phase requires submitting the following reports:

### **Function:**
### **Block Diagram:**
#### Sections
* Block Diagram
* 


**[Easy Block Diagram Generator](https://app.diagrams.net/)**

### **Schematic:**

An Image of your Schematic

### **Layout:**
### **Test:**
Describe test procedures to verify all functionalities.
### **Reliability:**
Analyze potential failure points and propose mitigation strategies.
### **Purchase:**
Request purchase approvals for components, consumables, and one-time purchases.

**Reports maybe excluded if they don't apply to your subsystem(eg. Structure)**

## **Header**

Each report will include a header with designated spaces for digital signatures through Git commits from:

* Subsystem Members
* Relevant Subsystem Leaders (if changes impact other subsystems)
* System Engineers
* Project Manager

**Rapid Prototyping:**

* We encourage rapid iteration on design and implementation.
* Once the Purchase report is signed off, the PCB will be quickly fabricated, enabling faster testing and validation cycles.





**Version Control and Changelog:**

* All modifications will be tracked using Git's version control system.
* A changelog will be maintained, documenting all changes made to each report.
* New report versions will be created for significant changes, requiring a new round of approvals.

**Rapid Prototyping:**

* We encourage rapid iteration on design and implementation.
* Once the Purchase report is signed off, the PCB will be quickly fabricated, enabling faster testing and validation cycles.

## Intro
These reports will:
* Allow everyone to work independently
* Allow everyone to prove their work in a structured way.
* Allow everyone to understand 

**Report Content:**
Each subsystem development phase requires submitting the following reports:

## **Headers**
Each report will include a header with designated spaces for digital signatures through Git commits from:

* Subsystem Members
* Relevant Subsystem Leaders (if changes impact other subsystems)
* System Engineers
* Project Manager

[Template](./TEMPLATE/header.md)

Don't forget to change the template name to your subsystem

**When a revision needs to be made after a report has already been signed off, clone the header and increase the version number.**

### Function:
State the main functions of the subsystem along with the supporting functions.

[Template](./TEMPLATE/function.md)

Use ChatGPT / Gemini to get a good idea of the functions you will potentially need along with the supporting functions.
Go into detail with the functions as these need to represent all actions that your subsystem has. The functions do not need to include specific values for instance:

**DO**: The reation wheels will rotate at a speed that will allow the cubesat to track an ground station.

**DON'T**: Have motors that will spin at 1300 RPM.

This is because the design report will include all the calculations.
This will allow easy recaculation if our parameters change.

### Design:

for example:




**Components**

for instance:

E-Fuse 

**Selection**


Finally a Block Diagram of all the active components will be needed along will the power and communication between the components.

### Schematic:

[Template](./TEMPLATE/schematic.md)

Creating a Schematic
Schematics will use the Utah Tech Cubesat Template


Everyone will use a Heicharchal Document
REFRENCE.schdoc will be used as


An Image of your Schematic

### Layout:

[Template](./TEMPLATE/layout.md)

### Test:
Describe test procedures to verify all functionalities.
### Reliability:
Analyze potential failure points and propose mitigation strategies.
### Purchasing
Request purchase approvals for components, consumables, and one-time purchases.

**Reports maybe excluded if they don't apply to your subsystem(eg. Structure)**

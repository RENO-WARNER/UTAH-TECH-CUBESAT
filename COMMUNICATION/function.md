* Establish Uplinks/Downlinks capabilities between orbital payload and ground based users. 
	* Reliable Signal 
		* Maintain Highest signal gain trajectory
    * Comprehensive logging
        * Keep ground based records of all connections
        * Keep track of all satellite current activities
        * Log all useful payload data and system data
    * System Level help data
        * Need to keep track of any and all handshake data that might be used to reconcile satellite behavior relative to ground station
        * Keep track of all necessary orbital behaviors to log satellite position
        * Keep logs of space based computer logs
        * Keep buffer of commands  
    * Have comprehensive UI flowstream for prevledged users
* Provide hardware for housing, controlling, actuating, and managing all ground base systems. 
    * Antenna actuation
        * Subsystem for actuators???
    * Water tight housing for all electronics
        * Per IP 68
    * Housing/electronics must be thermally stable
        * Heat is more of a problem than cold
        * We no cold here.

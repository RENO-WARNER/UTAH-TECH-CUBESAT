    "# OreSat Magnetorquers\n",
    "A magnetic torquer is a device that generates a magnetic dipole moment which produces a torque when interacting with the ambient magnetic field. These are used in spacecraft for rough attitude control, namely for momentum dumping operations, whether from deployment or reaction wheels. Theoretically, they may also be capable of compensating for residual magnetic moments inside the spacecraft from its electronic components, but that would be difficult to determine with certainty. Magnetorquers may have an air core or solid core, depending on mission requirements, but solid cores are generally preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "A magnetic torque rod is an electromagnet, consisting of a ferromagnetic cylinder wound with an excitation coil. By running current ($I$) through the coil, a magnetic field ($B$) is induced. The volume integral of the magnetic field generates the magnetic dipole moment ($M$). This interacts with the geomagnetic field ($B_E$) to produce a torque ($T$) which rotates the spacecraft, according to the equation $T = M \\times B_E$.\n",
